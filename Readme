Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation.

This project deploys a high availability web application via the AWS CloudFormation service. The file named bpudacityproject2.yml
is the actual CloudFormation template and the file named parameters.json contains the parameters used. Also included is a file called
createstack.sh which is a simple shell script that runs the AWS CLI create-stack command using the CFT, parameters file, and which also
includes the "capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM" request parameter which is needed due to the use of an IAM role.

To run the shell script and launch the CloudFormation stack follow the below example.

./createstack.sh <stackname> bpudacityproject2.yml parameters.json

Please see the folder 'Screenshots' for images showing actual script execution and successful CloudFormation stack deployment.
